# drag-widget-coordinate-upload
Draggable widget through jQuery with auto-upload of coordinates for later recall and positioning of widget

This is the starting point for a modular website/portfolio creation

The idea is to add widgets which have different content/purposes and their own properties such as size/position

This first part covers a single basic draggable widget which when released, uploads its coordinates to a sql database

When the page is reloaded, the widget is located where it was last dropped
